COMP 3033 Full-Stack Cloud Computing 
Assignment 3 
Single HTML Page with Content Page styled with Bootstrap  
My expectation for this is the use of Bootstrap classes only, applied to the HTML assignment 
from week 1.  The purpose of this assignment is to work with styling using Bootstrap (i.e., style 
your page using only Bootstrap classes). 
What’s the grading scheme?  I’m looking to for Bootstrap classes demonstrating the following 
(what you had styled with CSS in the previous assignment should be changed to use Bootstrap): 
1. A font, font colour and background colour applied to the whole site  
2. A styled navigation bar at the top 
3. A styled footer at the bottom 
4. A styled main body/content area (surrounding your images or lists, etc.) 
5. … other styling as you like (try styling another element on your site, of your choice, and 
indicate so with comments in your code – for example, add styles to HTML tables or 
lists)
